# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

THINGS TO DO;

1. Make the cart section show on hover and not show when not hovered
<!-- 2) When item is deleted from the cart, remove the item from the cart immediately  -->
2. Push item quantity and size to the cart
3. The cart button onClick opens the cart page with the full item details, option to adjust quantity, change size
4. In cart, have the option to delete the item from the cart or adjust quantity
5. if the item size is different, create a new cart
6. make cart window scrollable if there are a lot of items
7. the total price show reflect the each items price and the quantity it has

QUESTIONS
1.Why image of social not loading when going inside the singleItem page
2.Why I can't go from all shirt page to all pants page or shoes page or accessories?
3.What is the use of useEffect? 4. How to use a dummy API? 5. Usually, when you're building something like this, do you use any CSS library or framework such as bootstrap or is it usually designed in plain CSS? 6. Does the iterations that I have where cartArray objects are iterated and compared to totalData objects slow down the website?
